# Question

It is known that Sn = 1 + (1/2) + (1/3) + ... + (1/n). Clearly for any integer k, Sn > k when n is sufficiently large.
Now an integer k is given and it is required to compute a minimum n such that Sn>k.

# Input format

A positive integer k.

# Output format

A positive integer n.

# Sample input

1

# Sample output

2

# Description/Hint

[Data range].
For 100% of the data, 1 ≤ k ≤ 15.
