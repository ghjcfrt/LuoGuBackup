# Question

Try to count the total number of times the number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 9) occurs in all the integers in the interval 1 to n.
For example, the number 1 occurs 4 times in the interval 1 to 11, i.e. in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.

# Input format

2 integers n,x, separated by a space.

# Output format

1 integer indicating the number of occurrences of x.

# Sample input

11 1

# Sample output

4

# Hint

For 100% of the data, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 9.
